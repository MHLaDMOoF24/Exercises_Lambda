# ChatGPT generated exercises for learning to use Lambda expressions. 

Here are some C# exercises focused on learning and practicing lambda expressions:

## Exercise 1: Basic Lambda Expression
Create a list of integers from 1 to 10. Use a lambda expression to filter out all even numbers and display them.

Hint:

Use List<int> and Where method with a lambda expression.
## Exercise 2: Transforming Data
Given a list of strings representing names, use a lambda expression to convert each name to uppercase.

Hint:

Use the Select method with a lambda expression.
## Exercise 3: Sorting with Lambda
Create a list of strings with various words. Sort the list by the length of each word using a lambda expression.

Hint:

Use the OrderBy method with a lambda expression.
## Exercise 4: Calculating with Lambda
Given a list of integers, use a lambda expression to calculate the sum of all numbers greater than 5.

Hint:

Combine the Where and Sum methods with a lambda expression.
## Exercise 5: Custom Object Filtering
Suppose you have a Person class with properties Name and Age. Create a list of Person objects and use a lambda expression to filter out all people who are older than 30.

Hint:

Use the Where method with a lambda expression.
## Exercise 6: Using Action and Func Delegates
Create an Action delegate that prints a string and a Func delegate that takes two integers and returns their product. Use lambda expressions to implement both.

Hint:

Use Action<string> and Func<int, int, int> with lambda expressions.
## Exercise 7: Grouping Data
Given a list of strings representing different fruits, group the fruits by their first letter using a lambda expression.

Hint:

Use the GroupBy method with a lambda expression.
## Exercise 8: Complex Object Transformation
You have a Student class with properties Name, Marks, and Grade. Given a list of students, use a lambda expression to create a new list of objects containing only the Name and Grade of students who have a Marks greater than 70.

Hint:

Use the Where and Select methods with a lambda expression.
## Exercise 9: Combining Conditions
Given a list of integers, use a lambda expression to find all numbers that are both greater than 10 and divisible by 3.

Hint:

Use the Where method with a lambda expression that combines both conditions.
## Exercise 10: Creating a Custom Sort
Suppose you have a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a person's name and age (e.g., ("John", 25)). Use a lambda expression to sort the list first by name and then by age.

Hint:

Use the OrderBy and ThenBy methods with a lambda expression.
## Bonus Exercise: Nested Lambda Expressions
Given a list of Person objects with properties Name, Age, and Children (where Children is a list of Person objects), use a nested lambda expression to find all people who have children older than 18.

Hint:

Combine Where with a nested Any method.


### These exercises should give you a good foundation in using lambda expressions in C#.
